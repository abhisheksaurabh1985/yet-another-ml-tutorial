    "- Logit is a function that maps probabilities `[0, 1]` to `[-inf, +inf]`.\n",

    "$L = ln(p/(1-p))$ and $p = 1/ (1 + exp(-L))$\n",

    "Probability of 0.5 corresponds to a logit of 0. Negative logit correspond to probabilities less than 0.5, positive to > 0.5.\n",

    "- Softmax is a function that maps `[-inf, +inf]` to `[0, 1]` similar as Sigmoid. But Softmax also normalizes the sum of the values(output vector) to be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tensorflow \"with logit\": It means that you are applying a softmax function to logit numbers to normalize it. The input_vector/logit is not normalized and can scale from `[-inf, inf]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This normalization is used for multiclass classification problems. And for multilabel classification problems sigmoid normalization is used i.e. tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits"
